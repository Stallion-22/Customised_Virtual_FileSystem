# About the project
- In the project we emulate almost all the data structures which are used by operating system to manage File system oriented tasks.

- As the name suggest its virtual because we maintain all records in Primary storage.

- In the project we create almost all the data structures which required for File Subsystems as Inode Table, File Table, User File Descriptor Table, Super block, Disk Data Block etc.

- We have provided all implementations of necessary system calls and commands of File subsystem as Open, Close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, Fstat etc.

- While providing the implementations of all above functionality we use our own data structures.

- By using the project we can get an overview of UFS (UNIX File System) on any platform.
